# CMU Interactive Data Science Final Project

* **Title**: H-1B Data Application 
* **Team members**:
  * Erin Lin (lihsinl@andrew.cmu.edu)
  * Kylie Hsieh (hanjuh@andrew.cmu.edu)

## Abstract

The H-1B visa allows employers in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher in the specific specialty or its equivalent. We, as international students, will need to obtain an H-1B visa to work in the United States. However, there are only a limited number of visas available each year. It is beneficial for international students to have a one-stop platform to understand the visa application status quo of their interested employers.
